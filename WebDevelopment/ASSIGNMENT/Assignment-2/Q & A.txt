Q.1 What’s Box Model in CSS ? 
Ans. The Box Model in CSS is a fundamental concept that defines how elements are rendered on a web page. It consists of four main components: content, padding, border, and margin.

1. Content: It represents the actual content of an element, such as text, images, or other HTML elements.

2. Padding: It is the space between the content and the element's border. It provides internal spacing within the element.

3. Border: It is a line that surrounds the padding and content of an element. It separates the element from its neighboring elements.

4. Margin: It is the space outside the element's border. It creates the gap between the element and other elements on the page.

The Box Model allows you to control the dimensions and spacing of elements on a web page by manipulating the width, height, padding, border, and margin properties in CSS. Understanding the Box Model is crucial for accurately positioning and styling elements on a webpage.


Q.2 What are the Different Types of Selectors in CSS & what are the advantages of them?
Ans. CSS provides several types of selectors that allow you to target specific elements on a webpage. Here are some commonly used selectors and their advantages:

1. Element selectors: They target HTML elements by their tag names (e.g., `p`, `h1`, `div`). Element selectors are simple and easy to use, making them a good choice for styling multiple elements with the same tag.

2. Class selectors: They target elements based on their assigned class attribute (e.g., `.my-class`). Class selectors are versatile and can be applied to multiple elements, allowing for more targeted styling. They enable you to apply consistent styles to specific groups of elements.

3. ID selectors: They target elements based on their assigned ID attribute (e.g., `#my-id`). ID selectors are unique to a single element, making them ideal for styling individual elements. However, they should be used sparingly because using multiple IDs can lead to specificity conflicts.

4. Attribute selectors: They target elements based on their attribute values (e.g., `[type="text"]`). Attribute selectors offer flexibility in selecting elements based on specific attribute values. They can be useful when styling elements with specific attributes, such as input fields with specific types.

5. Pseudo-class selectors: They target elements based on their state or position within the document (e.g., `:hover`, `:nth-child`). Pseudo-classes allow you to apply styles to elements in specific conditions or based on their relationship to other elements. They are beneficial for creating interactive and dynamic effects.

6. pseudo-element selectors: Pseudo-elements allow you to style specific parts of an element, such as its first letter, first line, or generated content.

Each type of selector has its advantages depending on the specific requirements of your CSS styling. By utilizing these different selectors effectively, you can precisely target and style elements in your web pages.

Q.3 What is VW/VH ?
Ans. In CSS, VW (Viewport Width) and VH (Viewport Height) are relative units of measurement that allow you to specify sizes or distances relative to the dimensions of the browser viewport.

- VW (Viewport Width): 1 VW is equal to 1% of the width of the viewport. For example, if the viewport width is 1000 pixels, 1 VW would be equal to 10 pixels. VW units are useful for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.

- VH (Viewport Height): 1 VH is equal to 1% of the height of the viewport. Similar to VW, VH units allow you to specify sizes or distances based on the height of the viewport. For example, if the viewport height is 800 pixels, 1 VH would be equal to 8 pixels.

These units provide a way to create fluid and responsive layouts that adjust dynamically based on the size of the viewport. By using VW and VH units, you can make your designs more adaptable and ensure that elements scale proportionally across different devices and screen sizes.

Q.4 Whats difference between Inline, Inline Block and block ?
Ans. The main difference between inline, inline-block, and block elements in CSS lies in how they are displayed and how they interact with other elements on a webpage:

1. Inline elements: Inline elements are displayed in a line within the text flow and do not start on a new line. They only take up the necessary width and height to contain their content. Examples of inline elements include `<span>`, `<a>`, and `<strong>`. Inline elements cannot have a width or height set, and their margins and paddings only affect the space around the content, not the flow of surrounding elements.

2. Block elements: Block elements, on the other hand, start on a new line and take up the full available width by default. They create a block-level box and push subsequent elements to the next line. Examples of block elements include `<div>`, `<p>`, and `<h1>` to `<h6>`. Block elements can have a width, height, margins, and paddings set, and their dimensions and positioning affect the layout of surrounding elements.

3. Inline-block elements: Inline-block elements exhibit characteristics of both inline and block elements. They are displayed in a line like inline elements but can have dimensions, margins, and paddings like block elements. Inline-block elements do not start on a new line and respect the surrounding text flow. Examples of inline-block elements include `<img>`, `<button>`, and elements with the `display: inline-block` CSS property applied.

In summary, inline elements flow within the text, block elements start on a new line and take up the full width, while inline-block elements behave like inline elements but can have dimensions and spacing properties like block elements.


Q.5 How is Border-box different from Content Box?
Ans. The main difference between border-box and content-box is how they calculate the dimensions of an element. With content-box, you have to account for padding, border, and margin separately when setting the width or height. On the other hand, with border-box, the specified width or height includes the content, padding, and border, making it easier to manage and calculate the overall dimensions of an element.

Q.6 What’s z-index and How does it Function ?
Ans.`z-index` is a CSS property that controls the stacking order of elements on a webpage along the z-axis. It determines which element appears in front or behind other elements when they overlap in the same stacking context.

The `z-index` property accepts integer values and can be applied to positioned elements (elements with a positioning value other than `static`, such as `relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed`).

Here's how `z-index` functions:

1. Elements with a higher `z-index` value are positioned in front of elements with a lower `z-index` value within the same stacking context.

2. If two elements have the same `z-index` value, the stacking order is determined by the order of their appearance in the HTML structure. The element that comes later in the HTML will be positioned on top.

3. The `z-index` property only applies to elements that have a positioned ancestor. If an element has a `z-index` value but its ancestor elements do not have a positioned property (except for `position: static`), the `z-index` property will have no effect.

4. By default, elements have a `z-index` value of `auto`, which means their stacking order is determined by their position in the HTML structure and the order in which they are rendered.

5. Negative `z-index` values can be used to position elements behind other elements within the same stacking context.

The `z-index` property is useful for controlling the visibility and layering of overlapping elements. It allows you to create complex layouts, control the order in which elements appear, and manage the stacking order of elements within your web page.

Q.7 What’s Grid & Flex and difference between them?
Ans. In short:

- Grid: CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create complex grid-based layouts. It provides precise control over the placement and alignment of elements in rows and columns. Grid is well-suited for creating overall page layouts, with support for both rows and columns of varying sizes. It offers a powerful grid-based structure.

- Flexbox: CSS Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that focuses on distributing and aligning elements along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically). It provides flexibility in arranging elements within a container. Flexbox is ideal for creating responsive and flexible layouts, controlling the sizing, spacing, and alignment of elements within a row or column.

The main difference is that Grid is a two-dimensional layout system, allowing you to define both rows and columns, while Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that operates along a single axis. Grid is more suitable for creating overall page layouts with complex grid structures, while Flexbox is great for arranging and aligning elements within a container along a single direction. Both Grid and Flexbox offer powerful layout capabilities and can be used together or separately based on your specific layout needs.

Q.8 Difference between absolute and relative and sticky and fixed position explain with example.
ANs.Sure! Here's a brief explanation of the differences between absolute and relative positioning, as well as sticky and fixed positioning:

1. Absolute positioning: When an element is positioned absolutely, it is removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor or the document itself if no positioned ancestor is found. The element's position is defined using the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties. Other elements on the page will ignore the space occupied by the absolutely positioned element. An absolutely positioned element will not affect the positioning of other elements. Example:

```css
.container {
  position: relative;
}

.absolute-box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
}
```

2. Relative positioning: When an element is positioned relatively, it remains in the normal document flow, and its position is adjusted relative to its default position. It does not affect the positioning of other elements on the page. The element can be moved using the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties. Example:

```css
.relative-box {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
}
```

3. Sticky positioning: Sticky positioning is a hybrid of both relative and fixed positioning. It behaves like relative positioning until the element reaches a specified scroll threshold, at which point it "sticks" to a specific position on the screen, even when the page is scrolled. The sticky element will affect the layout of other elements until it reaches the scroll threshold. Example:

```css
.sticky-box {
  position: sticky;
  top: 20px;
}
```

4. Fixed positioning: When an element is positioned fixed, it is removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to the viewport (the browser window). The fixed element remains in the same position even when the page is scrolled. It does not affect the layout of other elements. Example:

```css
.fixed-box {
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
}
```

In summary, absolute positioning is relative to a positioned ancestor or the document itself, relative positioning adjusts an element's position relative to its default position, sticky positioning "sticks" an element at a specific scroll threshold, and fixed positioning positions an element relative to the viewport.
